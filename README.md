# About My-Prtfolio
This project is an ongoing showcase of the skills and tools that I've mastered in Front-End development. It is currently built using HTML5 and CSS3 and will be refactored over time as I grow my abilities. 

## Project Goals
**This webpage will be my portfolio and will be used as a tool to aid my job search and showcase my talents as a software enginner.**
The goal of the page is simply to display text and images, have some minor navigational capabilities, and allow a user to access the band's social platforms through functioning links.

## Technology and Tools
* HTML5
